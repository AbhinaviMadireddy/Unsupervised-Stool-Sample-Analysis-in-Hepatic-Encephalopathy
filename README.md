Liver cirrhosis is a condition where a patientâ€™s liver is damaged. This damage is permanent and if severe enough can make a transplant the only treatment option. 
[1]. Along with damage to the liver, some cirrhosis patients have an accumulation of toxins in the brain known as hepatic encephalopathy (referred to as HE) 
[2]. Researchers are trying to determine the relationship between the condition of the digestive system and HE.
