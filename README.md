## Unsupervised-Stool-Sample-Analysis-in-Hepatic-Encephalopathy

Liver cirrhosis is a condition where a patient’s liver is damaged. This damage is permanent and if severe enough can make a transplant the only treatment option. Along with damage to the liver, some cirrhosis patients have an accumulation of toxins in the brain known as hepatic encephalopathy (referred to as HE).Researchers are trying to determine the relationship between the condition of the digestive system and HE. 

In this project I have investigated the relationship between the microbial composition of the digestive tract and HE.

* I studied the relative abundance data for microbes in stool samples collected from two sets of patients: those with cirrhosis but not HE (HE0 population), and those with cirrhosis who have developed HE (HE1 populations).
* I have identified microbes with significantly altered abundance levels between both populations and the ways in which these abundance levels change.

Concepts applied:
* Data pre-processing and visualization
* Bayesian Networks
* Statistical analysis (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Multiple testing, Q-Q plot)
* Dimensionality reduction (Principal Component Analysis, t-SNE)
* Clustering (K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model clustering, Hierarchical clustering)
